## What the heck is kyykkä?

Kyykkä, a noble sport of accuracy, power and scheming is often seen to be played by students and alumni of Finnish technical Universities. The correct English translation of Kyykkä is [Finnish Skittles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_skittles).

In short, the goal is to remove the Skittles (Karttu in Finnish) from the opponents square, by throwing a wooden bat.

The legacy of Kyykkä dates back to ancient Karelians, who used to practice this recreational sport already hundreds of years ago.

## Hardly training

> We have a pro-team enrolled. The only player who has ever played before is crippled.

Codemate’s soon-to-be pro team started training for the World Cup of Kyykkä 2016 well before the event. Two days before the d-day we laid the skittles and smashed them in the supervision of the **last year’s WCOK champion** and another Kyykkä veteran at Codemate. We hoped that some that skill would transfer to our pro-team.

## Competition day

Saturday 30.1, the d-day, dawned at excellent conditions.

Team Codemate teleported to the arena, Oulu University parking lot, with happy moods and all the success ahead.

The company series included half a dozen teams, primarily from Oulu-area. It was rumoured that at least Esju would have a couple of pro players, which was key to gain some confidence prior to the battles.

The guys had crafted some pretty cool miniature Codemate flags and erected the mothership, better known as the corner flag from AC Oulu’s soccer field at Raatti.

The competition was really fun and we witnessed some great throws (Anu hitting 13 skittles at one throw) and a lot of Pikes (not hitting a single skittle).

## The results

> The only ones who succeed in Kyykkä are pros and first-timers.

All the hard training was not for vain.

Team Codemate was not last.

We had such a great time that WCOK 2017 is definitely the next target.
When we recover from this years after-party..
